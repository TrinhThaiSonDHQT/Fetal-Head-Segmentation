Primary metrics:
• Sensitivity/Recall: How many fetal heads did the model detect? (Should be >95%)
• Specificity: How often does it avoid false positives? (Should be >98%)
• Dice Coefficient: Compare against expert annotations (Target: ≥0.95)
Statistical tests:
• Bland-Altman Plot: Agreement between model and human measurements
• Paired t-test: Is there systematic bias in model predictions?
• Confidence Intervals: Report uncertainty (e.g., Dice = 0.978 ± 0.012)
