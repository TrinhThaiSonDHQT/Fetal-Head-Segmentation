## 10. Dataset Preparation (YOUR TASK)

**Before running `main.py`, ensure:**

- [ ] HC18 dataset downloaded
- [ ] Dataset organized as:
  ```
  dataset/
  ├── training_set/
  │   ├── images/       <- 999 ultrasound images
  │   └── masks/        <- 999 segmentation masks
  └── test_set/
      ├── images/       <- 335 ultrasound images
      └── masks/        <- 335 segmentation masks
  ```
- [ ] Image-mask filename correspondence verified
- [ ] All images readable (no corrupted files)

---

## 11. Hardware Check (YOUR TASK)

- [ ] GPU available? Check with: `torch.cuda.is_available()`
- [ ] Sufficient GPU memory? (≥8GB recommended)
- [ ] Adjust batch size in `main.py` if needed:
  - 8GB GPU → `BATCH_SIZE = 4`
  - 12GB GPU → `BATCH_SIZE = 8`
  - 16GB+ GPU → `BATCH_SIZE = 16`

---

## Quick Commands

### Run Verification (Already Passed)

```bash
python verify_implementation.py
```

### Start Training

```bash
python main.py
```

### Check GPU

```python
import torch
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"GPU name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
print(f"GPU memory: {torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1e9:.2f} GB")
```

## Expected Training Time

| GPU             | Batch Size | Time per Epoch | Total (100 epochs) |
| --------------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| RTX 3060 (12GB) | 8          | ~5-7 min       | ~8-12 hours        |
| RTX 3080 (10GB) | 8          | ~3-4 min       | ~5-7 hours         |
| RTX 4090 (24GB) | 16         | ~2-3 min       | ~3-5 hours         |

_Note: Times are approximate and depend on CPU, disk I/O, and other factors._

## What to Watch During Training

### Good Signs ✅

- Training loss decreases steadily
- Validation Dice increases to 90%+ by epoch 30
- Learning rate reduces appropriately (via scheduler)
- Best model updates frequently in early epochs

### Warning Signs ⚠️

- Training loss not decreasing after 10 epochs
- Validation Dice stuck below 80%
- NaN values in loss or metrics
- Huge gap between train and validation metrics (overfitting)

---

## Target Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target       | Trimester Breakdown                   |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| DSC    | 97.81% ± 1.2 | 1st: 96.53%, 2nd: 98.55%, 3rd: 98.36% |
| mIoU   | 97.90% ± 1.7 | 1st: 96.96%, 2nd: 98.76%, 3rd: 97.98% |
| mPA    | 99.18% ± 0.9 | 1st: 98.71%, 2nd: 99.78%, 3rd: 99.04% |

---

## Troubleshooting

### If training fails to start:

1. Check dataset paths in `main.py`
2. Verify dataset structure
3. Check GPU memory

### If performance is poor (<95% Dice):

1. Verify data preprocessing (grayscale, normalization)
2. Check FP+SAM integration
3. Ensure learning rate scheduler works
4. Increase training epochs

### If out of memory error:

1. Reduce batch size
2. Enable mixed precision training (add later)
3. Reduce model size (not recommended)

## Status: 🚀 READY TO TRAIN

All code verified and working. Dataset preparation is the only remaining task before training.
