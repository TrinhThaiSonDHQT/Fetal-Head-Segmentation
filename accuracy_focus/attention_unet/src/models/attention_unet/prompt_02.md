"Now, create a helper function called conv_block that:

1. Takes an input tensor and the number of filters as input.
2. Performs two sequential operations of: (3x3 Conv2D + Batch Normalization + ReLU activation).
3. Uses 'same' padding to keep the dimensions consistent.
4. Returns the output tensor."
