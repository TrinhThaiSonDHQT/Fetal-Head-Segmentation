The U-net network can be divided into two parts: The first is the contracting path that uses a typical CNN architecture. Each block in the contracting path consists of two successive 3 × 3 convolutions followed by a ReLU activation unit and a max-pooling layer. This arrangement is repeated several times. The novelty of U-net comes in the second part, called the expansive path, in which each stage upsamples the feature map using 2 × 2 up-convolution. Then, the feature map from the corresponding layer in the contracting path is cropped and concatenated onto the upsampled feature map. This is followed by two successive 3 × 3 convolutions and ReLU activation. At the final stage, an additional 1 × 1 convolution is applied to reduce the feature map to the required number of channels and produce the segmented image. The cropping is necessary since pixel features in the edges have the least amount of contextual information and therefore need to be discarded. This results in a network resembling a u-shape and, more importantly, propagates contextual information along the network, which allows it to segment objects in an area using context from a larger overlapping area.
